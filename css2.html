        <h1>ABOUT OF IPLTEAM</h1>  
       </li>
      
     <P>The IPL team from Delhi got a new name last year and would like to 
         improve their performance in the tournament from previous seasons. They 
         retained 14 players which gave them 11 free slots in their IPL squad for 
         the auction.
          The franchise went for an overall mixed approach in the auction and picked a bit of everything. 
          They spent quite a lot of money on bagging the best among the foreign players.
