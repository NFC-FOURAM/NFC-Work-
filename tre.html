 <p id="para"> Paswan was born in a Dalit family on 5 July 1946 in Shaharbanni, 
     Khagaria district of Bihar to Jamun Paswan and Siya Devi.[9][10] Paswan held a
     Bachelor of Laws and a Master of Arts degrees from Kosi College, Khagaria and
     Patna University.[11] He had been selected as a DSP in Bihar police in 1969.[12][13]</p>

     <li><h1 id="head">Political career</h1></li>
     <p id="para">Paswan was elected to the Bihar state legislative assembly in 1969[14] as a member of the Samyukta Socialist Party ("United Socialist Party") from Alauli, a reserved constituency. He lost 1972 Vidhan Sabha election from Alauli to Shri Mishri Sada of Congress. [15] In 1974, as an ardent follower of Raj Narain and Jayaprakash Narayan Paswan became the general secretary of the Lok Dal. He was personally close to the prominent leaders of anti-emergency like Raj Narain, Karpoori Thakur and Satyendra Narayan Sinha.[16]

     In 1975, when emergency was proclaimed in India, Paswan was arrested and spent the 
     entire period in jail. On being released in 1977, he became a member of the Janata 
     Party[17] and won election to Parliament for the first time on its ticket from Hajipur 
     with a record margin (later broken) of 424,000 and 89.3% votes which is perhaps an all-time 
     record for General Election in India. Former PM Narasimha Rao got a higher percentage of vote 
     in a 1991 bye-poll. When Janata Party split in 1979, he joined Charan Singh's faction. Paswan was 
     re-elected to the 7th Lok Sabha in 1980 from Hajipur constituency as Janata Party (Socialist) candidate.
     In 1983, he established the Dalit Sena, an organisation for Dalit emancipation and welfare. The Dalit Sena 
     was later headed by his brother Ram Chandra Paswan . Later It was renamed as Scheduled Caste sena in a vein
      similar to the Scheduled Caste federation established by 
     Bhim Rao Ambedkar.[18] Paswan lost 1984 Lok Sabha election from Hajipur.[19]</p>
